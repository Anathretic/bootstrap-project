# For-You (Website project with bootstrap elements)

## About

An example of a spa salon website with a well-planned UI that allows to quickly book a treatment via the booking form that appears after clicking the button on the left side of a screen.

## Coding & Problems

The site is not too different from [Just-Paradise](https://github.com/Anathretic/second-site), but it was created as a sandbox where I could practice Bootstrap or creating my own scroll-spy. The form is also taken from [Just-Paradise](https://github.com/Anathretic/second-site) but the achievement bar below the reviews shows the use of Intersection Observer.

Project was realized in cooperation with a graphic/UI designer [Julia Hyz](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/julia-hyz-098288274).

## Links & Tools

**Used:** HTML, CSS (incl. SASS preprocessor), JavaScript (incl. Intersection Observer), Gulp
