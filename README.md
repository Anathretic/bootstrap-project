# For-You (Website project with bootstrap elements)

## About

An example of a spa salon website with a well-planned UI that allows to quickly book a treatment via the booking form that appears after clicking the button on the left side of a screen.

The booking form was based on the Just-Paradise form, but a 4th page was also added. The achievement bar below the reviews shows the use of Intersection Observer.

Additionally, the navigation has been equipped with scroll-spy, thanks to which the user knows more precisely in which section he is.

## Links & Tools
